## Hi, I'm Pedro! 👋

**M.Sc. in Physics**

I'm a **Master's degree in Physics** currently working as Data Engineer and Data Scientist with over **4 years of experience** building solutions that combine data engineering, machine learning, cloud infrastructure, and software development.

I work across the **full ML/DL lifecycle** — data collection, feature engineering, training, deployment, versioning, and monitoring — with hands-on experience in both traditional ML and Deep Learning, especially **Gradient Boosting**–based models.

On the engineering side, I develop and maintain **robust data and MLOps pipelines**, focusing on model governance, inference monitoring, containerization, and scalable deployment (e.g., **Vertex AI**, Docker, Airflow).

I also have strong expertise in **infrastructure and distributed systems**, especially in **Kubernetes cluster management**, CI/CD automation, and cloud environments.
